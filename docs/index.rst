Python babymaker (flat ntuple generation tool) library. `babymaker`_ was
originally conceived by Manuel Franco Sevilla and his colleagues at UCSB. It
was later rewritten by Yipeng Sun to make it simpler, and more portable. The
result is this project: ``pyBabyMaker``.

The ``pyBabyMaker`` library provides the following tools to aid ntuple
processing:

- ``ntpdump``: Dump ntuple tree structure.
- ``babymaker``: Generate ``C++`` code to process ntuples.

It also provides several libraries to ease the creation of a ``C++`` code
generator.
