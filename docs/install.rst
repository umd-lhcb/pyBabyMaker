Installation
------------

This package requires ``Python 3.7+``. Also, please make sure ``ROOT``,
``gcc``, and ``pip`` are installed.  Make sure that ``root-config`` is
available in your ``$PATH``, and ``gcc`` supports ``-std=c++14``.

``clang-format`` will automatically be used to format generated ``C++`` code,
if it is available in your ``$PATH``.

Currently, ``pyBabyMaker`` is not on ``PyPI``. To install:

.. code-block:: console

   # pip install git+https://github.com/umd-lhcb/pyBabyMaker
   $ pip install --user git+https://github.com/umd-lhcb/pyBabyMaker
