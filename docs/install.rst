Installation
============

This package requires ``Python 3.7+``. Note that starting from ``0.3.5``, this
package no longer depends ``ROOT`` and is now a purely Python package.

``clang-format`` will automatically be used to format generated ``C++`` code,
if it is available in your ``$PATH``.

``pyBabyMaker`` is available on ``PyPI``:

.. code-block:: console

   pip install pyBabyMaker

If you want to install the latest develop version:

.. code-block:: console

   pip install git+https://github.com/umd-lhcb/pyBabyMaker
